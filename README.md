# DigitalXC Secret Santa Coding Challenge

## Overview
This project automates the Secret Santa assignment process for the company "Acme." Employees are assigned a secret child for gift-giving, with rules to avoid self-assignments and repeat pairings from previous years.

## Project Structure
- `src/secret_santa.py`: Main code for generating Secret Santa assignments.
- `data/`: Folder containing input files and the generated output file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (included in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the code:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python secret_santa.py
   ```

## Output
The output file, `Secret_Santa_Assignments.csv`, will be saved in the `data` directory.
